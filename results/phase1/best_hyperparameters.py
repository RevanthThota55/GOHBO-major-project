# Best hyperparameters found by GOHBO optimization
# Generated automatically - do not edit by hand

# Learning rate: How fast the model learns
# A value of 0.001 provides good balance - not too fast (overshoots) or too slow (takes forever)
BEST_LEARNING_RATE = 0.001

# Batch size: How many images the model looks at before updating
# 32 is a good middle ground - larger uses more memory, smaller is slower
BEST_BATCH_SIZE = 32

# Epochs: How many times the model goes through ALL the training images
# 80 epochs gives enough time to learn without overfitting
BEST_EPOCHS = 80
